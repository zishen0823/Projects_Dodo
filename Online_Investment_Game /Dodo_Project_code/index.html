  <b>Let's Play Around!</b>
  <br><br/>
  <b>There is one fund acts better than the others. Can you figure out which one is it?</b>

  <p>Among these 25 funds, there is one fund that has a annual growing rate of 9% on average,<br/>
    and the rest funds all have 5% as the annual growing rate on average.<br/>
    If you can figure that fund out, you are more likely to beat the market.<br/>
    The blanks are for you to manage the percentages of how would you like to buy the funds,<br/>
    so the sum cannot exceed 100(%), and if it does, a warning will show up.<br/>
    The previous 3 year performance is already given.<br/>
    You can use all the precede growing rates of each funds to guess which one has 9% as the average<br/>
    annually growing rate.<br/><br/>
    Note: it is highly recommend to have a sum of your input numbers as 100 in order to be more<br/>
    likely to beat the market, since the market tends to grow.<br/><br/>
    The game will end at the 15th year. At that time, if your cumulative profit is larger than<br/>
    the cumulative profit of the market, then you beat the market! Congratulations!!
