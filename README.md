# Projects_Dodo
This projects repo contains the main class projects I have done in UC Berkeley.

Handwritten_Digits_Recognition
•	The goal of this project is to take an image of a handwritten single digit (eg.0,1..9) and determine which digit it is by 
developing a nearest neighbor classifier. These handwritten digits are in gray-scale and transformed into a big matrix with 
numbers indicating the darkness of the color. 
• Developed R code to set up a model to identify handwritten digits images through K-Nearest Neighbors and Cross-validation, 
and the accuracy of prediction was 92.5%. 

Online_Investment_Game 
• Inspired by Buttonwood's article “Picking a fund manager? The odds aren’t great” on the newspaper The Economist, 
a simple game was built to show the conclusion in the article: it is hard for the market investor to pick a successful fund 
manager. In this game, real-life funds are simulated and the existence of a better performance fund is assumed. Several strategies 
for the game players to find the better performance fund were tried, and the results of these strategies were compared and analyzed.
•	Used JavaScript and HTML to build a website that allows player to invest on 25 funds with different allocations each year 
for a total 12-year period. The profit gained by the player is compared with the avg. market index to see if the player beat 
the market by recognizing the good-paying fund.

Hotel_Occupancy_Time_Series_Modeling_and_Prediction
•	In this project, we select the monthly occupancy of O'Donovan's Hotel in Ireland from January, 1963 to December, 1976. 
This hotel is located in Clonakilty, which is the tourism hub, so the analysis of this data set can give us a better understanding 
on the changes in hotel demand in a tourist region. This data set is obtained from the Times Series Data Library created by Rob 
Hyndman, Professor of Statistics at Monash University, Australia. For our analysis, we mainly focus on building the model in two ways: 
Spectral Analysis and ARIMA.

Census_Income_Data_Set_Classification
• The data set for this project is the Census Income Data Set donated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker to the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository. It describes 15 variables on a sample of individuals from the US Census database. The prediction task is to determine 
whether a person makes over 50K a year using the rest 14 variables.
